          <p>Welcome to my webpage! <br> <br>
           I’m a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Zurich. I hold a MPhil in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge. <br> <br>
           My focus is on macroeconomics. I am specialized in macroeconomic theory and in computational methods in macroeconomics. My doctoral advisors are Florian Scheuer and Felix Kübler. I care about firm dynamics in macroeconomic models; an upcoming theoretical paper of mine with Igli Bajo and Alessandro Ferrari discusses how the productivity distribution of firms in an economy interacts with cleansing effects of recessions. Currently, I am working to apply <i>sequence-space jacobian</i> (Auclert, Rognlie & Straub) solution methods in heterogeneous firm models, to learn more about how policy interacts with firms along a transitional path.</p>

    # Research and Publications

    ## Research Statement

    I am interested in Macroeconomics and Public Finance. My macroeconomic research can be best summarized as **firms in general equilibrium**. I am interested in models which capture firm dynamics through the business cycle, and their interaction with fiscal and monetary policy. In public finance, I am working on **capital gains and inter-generational taxation**. Specifically, I am working to disentangle the effects of end-of-life provisions on portfolio choice and size of inheritances.

    During 2019-2021 I was an economist (pre-doctoral fellow) at the *Center for the Economics of Human Development* at *University of Chicago* for Prof. James J. Heckman. My research from this period was mainly focused on public economics and the evaluation of social programs.

    ## Publications

    ### Journal Articles

    1.  **The Dynastic Benefits of Early-Childhood Education: Participant Benefits and Family Spillovers** \[[link](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ng02LRMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=ng02LRMAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC)\] <br>
        Frederik H. Bennhoff, Jorge L. García, Duncan Ermini Leaf <br>
        *Journal of Human Capital* 18 (1), 44-73

        ???+ Summary
            <div> We demonstrate the social efficiency of investing in high-quality early-childhood education using newly collected data from the HighScope Perry Preschool Project. The data analyzed are the longest follow-up of any randomized early-childhood education program. Annual observations of participant outcomes up to midlife allow us to provide a cost-benefit analysis without relying on forecasts. Adult outcomes on the participants’ children and siblings allow us to quantify spillover benefits. The program generates a benefit-cost ratio of 6.0 (*p*-value = .03). Spillover benefits increase this ratio to 7.5 (*p*-value = .00)</div>

    ## Working Papers & Ongoing Projects

    1.  **Not-So-Cleaning Recessions** <br>
        Igli Bajo, Frederik H. Bennhoff, Alessandro Ferrari <br>
        *Draft in preparation.*

        ???+ Summary
            <div> Recessions are periods in which the least productive firms in the economy exit, and as the economy recovers, they are replaced by new and more productive entrants. These *cleansing effects* imply that business cycles generate improvements in the average firm productivity. We argue that this is not sufficient to induce long-run gains in GDP and welfare. We show that these are driven by the intensity of *love-for-variety* in households' preferences. If the household has CES preferences, recessions do not bring about any improvement in GDP and welfare. If the economy features more *love-for-variety* than CES, the social planner finds it optimal to subsidize economic activity in recessions to avoid firm exit. </div>


    2.  **Capital Gains Taxation in Life and Death** <br>
        Frederik H. Bennhoff, Florian Scheuer

        ???+ Summary
            <div> End-of-life provisions determine the tax base of capital gains, when assets are bequeathed. Up until today, there existed no quantitative model to simulate the effects of changing end-of-life provisions, which jointly takes into account the reactions of households at two margins: (1) composition of the asset portfolio and (2) total size of the bequeathed estate. We build a novel, unifying framework in which one can simulate the consequences of different end-of-life provisions, bequest taxes and other income taxes simultaneously, thereby surpassing the current state-of-the-art at several margins. We do so by recasting the definition of asset portfolios, which makes the household problem theoretically and quantitatively tractable. </div>
