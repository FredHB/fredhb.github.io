My name is Frederik, founder of ***ex.ante***, and a PhD student in Economics at the University of Zürich, currently visiting LSE. I brought ***ex.ante*** to life because I want to document my research, teaching and opinion on all things economics.

Through ***ex.ante***, I hope to disseminate my research, share teaching materials on recent methodological advances, and engage in meaningful economic commentary.

My focus is on macroeconomics. I am specialized in macroeconomic theory and in computational methods in macroeconomics. My doctoral advisors are Florian Scheuer and Felix Kübler. I care about firm dynamics in macroeconomic models; an upcoming theoretical paper of mine with Igli Bajo and Alessandro Ferrari discusses how the productivity distribution of firms in an economy interacts with cleansing effects of recessions. Currently, I am working to apply *sequence-space jacobian* (Auclert, Rognlie & Straub) solution methods in heterogeneous firm models, to learn more about how policy interacts with firms along a transitional path.
