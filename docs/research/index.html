<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>I am interested in Macroeconomics and Public Finance. My
macroeconomic research can be best summarized as <strong>firms in
general equilibrium</strong>. I am interested in models which capture
firm dynamics through the business cycle, and their interaction with
fiscal and monetary policy. In public finance, I am working on
<strong>capital gains and inter-generational taxation</strong>.
Specifically, I am working to disentangle the effects of end-of-life
provisions on portfolio choice and size of inheritances.</p>
<p>During 2019-2021 I was an economist (pre-doctoral fellow) at the
<em>Center for the Economics of Human Development</em> at <em>University
of Chicago</em> for Prof. James J. Heckman. My research from this period
was mainly focused on public economics and the evaluation of social
programs.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>We demonstrate the social efficiency of investing in high-quality
early-childhood education using newly collected data from the HighScope
Perry Preschool Project. The data analyzed are the longest follow-up of
any randomized early-childhood education program. Annual observations of
participant outcomes up to midlife allow us to provide a cost-benefit
analysis without relying on forecasts. Adult outcomes on the
participants’ children and siblings allow us to quantify spillover
benefits. The program generates a benefit-cost ratio of 6.0
(<em>p</em>-value = .03). Spillover benefits increase this ratio to 7.5
(<em>p</em>-value = .00)</p>

<li><p><strong>Not-So-Cleaning Recessions</strong><br />
Igli Bajo, Frederik H. Bennhoff, Alessandro Ferrari<br />
<em>Draft in preparation.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Recessions are periods in which the least productive firms in the
economy exit, and as the economy recovers, they are replaced by new and
more productive entrants. These <em>cleansing effects</em> imply that
business cycles generate improvements in the average firm productivity.
We argue that this is not sufficient to induce long-run gains in GDP and
welfare. We show that these are driven by the intensity of
<em>love-for-variety</em> in households’ preferences. If the household
has CES preferences, recessions do not bring about any improvement in
GDP and welfare. If the economy features more <em>love-for-variety</em>
than CES, the social planner finds it optimal to subsidize economic
activity in recessions to avoid firm exit. We show that the extent of
<em>love-for-variety</em> can be estimated in the data using production
function estimation techniques.</p>

<li><p><strong>Capital Gains Taxation in Life and Death</strong><br />
Frederik H. Bennhoff, Florian Scheuer</p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>End-of-life provisions determine the tax base of capital gains, when
assets are bequeathed. Up until today, there existed no quantitative
model to simulate the effects of changing end-of-life provisions, which
jointly takes into account the reactions of households at two margins:
(1) composition of the asset portfolio and (2) total size of the
bequeathed estate. We build a novel, unifying framework in which one can
simulate the consequences of different end-of-life provisions, bequest
taxes and other income taxes simultaneously, thereby surpassing the
current state-of-the-art at several margins. We do so by recasting the
definition of asset portfolios, which makes the household problem
theoretically and quantitatively tractable.</p>
